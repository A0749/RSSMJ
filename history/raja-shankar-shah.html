              Raja Shankar Shah was a descendant of the illustrious Raj Gond Kings of Garha Mandla, the grandson of Nizam Shah, and the son of Sumer Shah. When Nizam Shah passed away in 1776, after ruling for 27 years, several factions aimed to secure the throne. With the support of Rani Bilas Kunwar, the eldest wife of the late Raja Nizam Shah, Narhar Shah, the nephew of Nizam Shah ascended the throne. Soon Sumer Shah, contested the throne which led to a power struggle between Sumer Shah and Narhar Shah.

              Sumer Shah proceeded to Sagar and sought the aid of Maratha Raghunath Rao, Jagirdar of Sagar, offering a substantial payment. With the assistance of Beesajee and Moorajee, the leaders of the Maratha expedition, Sumer Shah was placed on the throne in 1781. However, due to internal rivalry between Narhar Shah and Sumer Shah, there were frequent power shifts between the descendants of Nizam Shah. Later, when Sagar was acquired by the Marathas of Nagpur State in 1796, Sumer Shah was granted a village as a Jagir (estate) for his subsistence.

              Sumer Shah was honorably employed in Sagar, where he called his family and had a son, Shankar Shah, with his wife, Tejkunwari Dev. Following Sumer Shah’s death, his son, Raja Shankar Shah, led a wandering life, spending considerable time with the Pindari leader Meer Khan. In 1809, Shankar Shah joined Meer Khan’s invasion of the Mandla region, who promised to restore Shankar Shah to his ancestral lands. After driving out Narayen Rao, the subedar of Jabalpur, Shankar Shah was declared king in Jabalpur with Meer Khan’s support. However, the Pindaris were defeated by a large force sent by Nagpur State (which had come under British control) at Jahura in 1810.

              On December 19, 1817, the territories of Mandla and Jabalpur were ceded to the British by a treaty with Peshwa Baji Rao II, dated June 13, 1817. Raja Shankar Shah lived for two to three years in a village assigned to his father, Sumer Shah, as a Jagir, before moving to Jabalpur in 1818. The village’s produce, amounting to 2,500 rupees, was his only means of subsistence, supplemented by voluntary contributions from several Bundela chiefs.

              As anticipation of the 1857 uprising grew, Raja Shankar Shah resolved to join the struggle against Britishers, determined to get back his ancestral lands from British control. A skilled poet, he composed a powerful poem dedicated to the goddess Chandi at Purba, now known as Mallah Devi, pleading for divine intervention in their struggle. The poem, which expressed his fervent desire to finish the British, was considered by Britishers as Raja’s deep-seated conspiracy against the East India Company used as critical evidence during his trial.  Accused of treasonous correspondence with the Bengal Native Infantry, Raja Shankar Shah and his son were arrested on September 14, 1857. They were sentenced to be executed by being blown away by cannon, a sentence carried out on September 18, 1857.
