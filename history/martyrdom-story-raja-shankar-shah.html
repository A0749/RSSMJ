              ‘At the head of the conspiracy was Shunker Shah, the Gond rajah,
              and his son. Their place of abode is about four miles from
              Jabalpur. In former days, this family ruled over all this part of
              the country; they can trace their descent for sixty generations.
              The family had been deprived of everything by the Mahrattas and
              were in great poverty when we took possession. Our government
              raised them up from this state and gave them sufficient to support
              themselves comfortably; and now they showed their gratitude by
              conspiring against us in our time of sore trial.

              The family have neither much property nor power, but the ancient
              name and prestige was a point on which to rally. On the 18th, at
              11 o’clock A.M., our two guns were advanced a few hundred yards in
              front of the Residency, covered by a company of the 33d and a few
              troopers. It became known that the Gond rajah and his son were
              about to be blown away from the cannon’s mouth.

              Despite this internal conflict, Raghunath Shah and his father,
              Raja Shankar Shah, united in their opposition to British colonial
              rule. Their struggle against the British was part of a broader
              resistance movement in central India, where local rulers and
              leaders were increasingly disillusioned with the East India
              Company’s oppressive policies. In Jabalpur, Raghunath and his
              father fought to drive the British out of their land, committing
              themselves to the cause of Indian independence long before the
              major uprising of 1857. Their anti-British plan, however, were
              discovered by the colonial authorities. Both father and son were
              arrested, and in a harsh display of British might, they were
              sentenced to death.

              The old man walked up to the guns with a firm stride; the son
              appeared more dejected. The old man, with his snow-white hair and
              firm manner, almost excited compassion. One had to remember,
              before such feelings could be checked, how atrociously he intended
              to deal with us had his conspiracy succeeded; the evidence of his
              guilt was overwhelming.

              All was over in a few minutes. The scattered remains were pounced
              upon by kites and vultures, but what could be collected was handed
              over to the ranee.’
